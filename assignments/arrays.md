### Question: 1

A team of experts formed under the supervision of the prime minister of india conducted a survey on some of the top colleges of india. They were sent to most of the institutions to check on the facilities, academics and infrastructure. The experts’ team then gave a report of 50 top universities in India to the prime minister. Prime minster then asks them to make two lists of the first 10 universities and the remaining universities. Write a Java program to depict the above scenario and display the results.
(Hint: Input the array and divide it in required number of arrays)

### Question: 2

Given a set of elements, write Java program to perform cyclic right shift of the array by 'm' places.
For example, if the elements are 12, 13, 16, 7, 10 and m =2 then the resultant set will be 7, 10, 12, 13, 16.

### Question: 3

Two numbers are said to be amicable if the sum of proper divisors of one number plus 1, is equal to the other number.
All divisors of a number other than 1 and itself, are called proper divisors.
For example, the numbers 220 and 284 are amicable as the sum of proper divisors of 220 (i.e.) 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110 is equal to 284 and sum of proper divisors of 284 (i.e.) 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142 is 220.
Given two numbers, write an algorithm and the subsequent Java code to Print Yes if the given two numbers are amicable.
Print ‘No’ if the given numbers are not amicable. Check for boundary conditions and print 'Invalid input' for wrong input.
Write appropriate functions for accomplishing the task.

### Question: 4

Funda has got flu. Her doctor prescribed her 'x' number of 20mg pills, and told her to take a pill every 'y' hours starting from ‘s’ a.m to ‘e’ p.m. Write a Java code to find out, in how many days Funda will consume 'x' pills. For example, if 'x' is thirty, 'y' is four, ‘s’ is 9 am and ‘e’ is 10 pm then approximately the tablets will be consumed in 8 days. Use ceil function of math module to round the number of days. Time for start and finish of tablet can be read as an integer. Write appropriate functions for accomplishing the task.

### Question: 5

Given a set of elements, write an Java program to determine the second smallest element in it without using sort.

# Array Questions | Difficulty Level: Hard

### Question 1:

A triangular pattern with ‘n’ rows is formed with ‘i’ numbers in the i - th row, starting from the first row. In a triangular pattern, The number of elements in the first row will be 1; the number of elemnts in the second row will be 2 ; and so on.
For example, if the value of ‘n’ is 3 and if the elements in each row are : First row has only one element , namely, 1 ; second row has two elements, namely, 2, 1 ; The third rwo has three elements, namely, 1, 2, 3.
1
2 1
1 2 3
Path in a triangular pattern is described as the sequence of numbers, with one number taken from each row, starting from the first row till the last row. For example, the paths in the pattern above are
1 – 2 – 1
1 – 2 – 2
1 – 2 – 3
1 – 1 - 1
1 – 1 – 2
1 – 1 - 3
Value of a Path is the sum of the numbers in that path. In the above illustration, Maximum value of the paths in the is ‘6’. Write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to compute the maximum value among the paths in the triangular pattern.
Input Format
First line contains an integer ‘n’ which indicates the number of rows in the triangular patters
Next few lines contains the input for the triangular pattern
Output Format
Print the maximum value of the path in a triangular pattern
